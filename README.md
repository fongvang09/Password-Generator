# 03 Javascript: Password Generator

This project is about creating a password generator that uses lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The password amount should be anywhere between 8 characters to 128 characters long.

## What's the purpose behind this project?

In a world that is quickly developing, there are hackers out there developing their hacking skills as well. With cyber attacks on the rise, it is crucial that employees and employers alike keep their passwords long and strong and to change it frequently. The purpose behind this project is to build a random but strong password that contains all of the alphanumeric characters as well as symbols to ensure that any online users may be able to protect their data. Every weak passwords often leads to their informations being leaked. To prevent their passwords from being compromised, experts recommend that people update their passwords at least every three months.

## How to use?

1. Simply open the Password Generator.
2. Click on the button "Generate Password".
3. It'll prompt you to type in a value.
4. Click on the "OK" button.
6. Copy and store your newly generated password in a safe, secure spot!

Note: It is unfortunate that the range on the number of characters and the checkboxes are not in sync with the password generated and adjusting or checking them in will not affect the password generated. In our next version, Password Generator 2.0, we'll have those fully functional.
